# SoundAware
Automatic sound settings for your phone based on your environment.

This repo is for the Android version, other platforms to come later.

A new generation of managing the sound on your phone based on your surroundings. They could be time based (ex. late at night), they could be activity based (ex. working out), or they could be location based (ex. at work)
